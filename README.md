Password Generator - Homework 3

This assignment uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a generator that provides randomized passwords based on a criteria of letters and numbers that the user agrees to. The JavsScript focuses heavily on if/else statements, arrays, eventlisteners and global variables that allow randomized pulling from multiple constants to create a unique password after cycling through the prompts and agreeing to the conditions.
